## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- BEM Naming
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

During this challenge i had the opportunity to work on CSS Grid right on the project, and not just as part of a tutorial. How usefull CSS Grid could be was really clear.

### Continued development

On following projects that require CSS Grid i will try to minimize the amount of grid code to the absolute necessary. This, i believe, will make me understand more of what's going on with grid system.

### Useful resources

- [A Complete Guide to Grid (https://css-tricks.com/)](https://css-tricks.com/snippets/css/complete-guide-grid/) - Amazing website, and also amazing article which cover's maybe everything about CSS Grid and it's properties with very comprehensive examples. Strongly recommended for anyone, beginner or not!
